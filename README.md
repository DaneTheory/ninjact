# NINJACT
## A ReactJS Boilerplate For Ninja Devs
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaneTheory/ninjact/master/src/public/images/ninjact.png" />

### Praise Jesus, another boilerplate....
<p>I get it. I didn't make this to save the world and all of your engineering woes. BUT, what I did do is make something for devs to get started quickly AND new users to start working with. This is as bare bones as it gets. I plan on building on top of this after I feel more confident in a seemless full-stack React workflow.</p>

###### This will always and forever try to be as unopinionated as possible.
<p>Everyone has their favorite tools. I'm cool with that. Personally, I like React and I believe strongly that it ain't goin' anywhere anytime soon.</p>

#### Installation Instructions:
<p>Download/fork the repo into your own branch on your local</p>
<p>Unzip</p>
<p>cd into the directory</p>
<p>run <code>npm i</code></p>
<p>run <code>npm run dev</code></p>
<p>Your terminal will outlput the URL on your local for viewing (default is http://localhost:8080)</p>
<p>To see some webpack awesomeness, checkout http://localhost/webpack-dev-server:8080</p>
  
#### WHAT WORKS:
  <ul>
    <li>ES6</li>
    <li>JSX</li>
    <li>BABEL</li>
    <li>HOT MODULE LOADING</li>
    <li>WEBPACK PLUS DEV SERVER</li>
    <li>BASIC SCAFFOLDING</li>
  </ul>

#### WHAT I WANT TO GET WORKIN':
  <ul>
    <li>SASS/SCSS via Webpack (maybe gulp....)</li>
    <li>BrowserSync For live CSS changes</li>
    <li>Better notifications/alerts on build breaks/errors</li>
    <li>REDUX</li>
    <li>Wicked cool demos</li>
    <li>More time to write better docs.</li>
  </ul>
